### GCP Delay ML Model App

This project was part of an interview process challenge for airline company, where a XGBoost 
Classification model was developed and trained to predict flight delays. The model was 
implemented using Python 3 and an API was built using FastAPI and deployed on Google Cloud Run.

The project is located in another [repository](https://github.com/scaceresg/proj-challenge-LATAM.git).
